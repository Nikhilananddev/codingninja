/*Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array.
You should start traversing your array from 0, not from (N - 1).
Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.
Input Format :
Line 1 : An Integer N i.e. size of array
Line 2 : N integers which are elements of the array, separated by spaces
Line 3 : Integer x
